Implementation of the unimplemented method initiliaze(scs[]) of class AccumulatorResultSet, to allow me to modify the result set's score obtained

The VSM class retrieve the file using the classi vector space model, computing the L2 norm online.

VectorNormalizer it's a stand-alone class which compute the L2 norm of the documents a priori

The VSM class retrieve the file using the class vector space model using the L2 norm pre-computed by VectorNormalizer

TF_IDF2 is a matching model obtained modifying the Terrier's standard TF_IDF model, deleting the Robertson's norm. It's possible to set it from the .properties of Terrier. It necessites to be in the src folder of the others matching models
